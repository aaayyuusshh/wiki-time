 <h1 align="center">WikiTime</h1>
 <p align="center">This extension displays the estimated reading time of Wikipedia articles.</p>

## Overview
WikiTime parses the `html` of an article, extracts the relevant words in it, then uses the word count and the user's reading speed _(words per minute)_ to calculate the estimate. 

The default reading speed used is 300 words per minute. Click on the extension icon to set your own reading speed.

Certain sections like _References_, _Citations_, _Notes_ are ignored during parsing. These sections have the potential to unreasonaly skew reading times to be much higher.

Each image adds x seconds to the reading time. <sub>(🚧  currently working on)</sub>

**Note** _The main goal here is to provide a rough idea of how long an article might take to read, actual reading times will vary. This is supposed to be just an estimation remember?_ 😉
