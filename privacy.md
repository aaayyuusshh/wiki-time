## What Data We Collect

WikiTime uses Chrome extension APIs that access limited data necessary for the extension to function properly:

We do **not** collect any personal or identifiable information.

The extension uses the above data solely to provide its core functionality:

- Refresh open Wikipedia tabs to reflect the updated reading time when WPM changes.
- Inject content scripts on Wikipedia articles to display the reading time dynamically.
